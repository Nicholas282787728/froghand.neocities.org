Despite my previous objections, oh, around July where I parodied the tagline of XKCD and called it a sell-out, I still like XKCD. Sorry, I mistyped that - I liked XKCD. I liked it when it was an experimental comic that actually lived up to its promises of "romance, sarcasm, math, and language", nowadays being "science, science, science, pandering to nerds". Without getting exhaustive, as ain't nobody got time for that (and I'm the one bitching about pandering), if you look at the comics from before 2013, you find a lot more depth of character in the webcomic, with less of a reliance on creating comics that could be easily shared on Reddit or what have you, in favour of creating those with more absurdity that didn't rely on an appreciation of the natural sciences - and whatever appreciation required could be gleaned from the context of the comic, which was still often thought-provoking in its own right. The original art style of stick figures, charmed by its imperfections, now seem lazy after over a decade of standardised artwork, never willing to push the boundaries of its art style, unlike. This is a topic for a different review (protip: if you run out of article ideas, go into the BUAFYS and search for "review"), though the long and short of it that XKCD felt more natural in its early days, now feeling like they're created to be shared like dancing bears, not to be appreciated. The XKCD Wiki documents these comics in a neatly categorised way - and if you can get past their explanations beating the joke worse than OJ Simpson and his wife (topical reference), it'll help you find the good work that made the comic so popular in the first place.</p>

But beyond Facebook's racism, there is another problem, which is the amount of control that Facebook has in destroying people's live. You always hear the old men bitching about the lack of communication we have nowadays - I've often bitched about it myself, if only because talking to somebody is one of the most precious things you can do for a person - but given that use of Facebook is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/04/08/new-study-links-facebook-to-depression-but-now-we-actually-understand-why/#64ebf8592e65">linked to depression</a> (<a href="https://archive.fo/UztYB">archive</a>) because it causes you to develop unrealistic expectations of how other people are enjoying their lives, while causing you to constantly compare your real-life experiences to those constantly-pruned and self-censored feeds, perhaps the blokes has a point in that avoiding Facebook lets you appreciate the "reality" of reality, in all its imperfections. No matter how optimistic we are about the future, the simple fact of the world is that it is imperfect, and trying to fight against a fact that has been true for millenia, even with all the world's ability to communicate and bring ideas to life, is a folly. Well, consider now that, not only do you feel like shit for using Facebook, but Facebook has the ability to arbitrarily shut down your profile at any given point in time, and then cause you to be shit out of luck for both your business and personal life. The latest shutdown of Koko's Facebook page demonstrates this simple face - and is another reason why Facebook should not be trusted to do anything sensible.</p>

What Seth has done is make a book that gets more relevant the more detached from school you are - the more you realise that, for twelve years of your life, you were essentially in what is either a daycare or a prison depending on your experiences, institutionalising our children to be as standard as possible in a world which absolutely, above all else, does <i>not</i> reward the standard way of living. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a decent high school, where they granted us enough autonomy to do whatever we liked so long as we passed our courses, and as a result of which created a student body with a wide and deep array of interests that they happen to be very good at. Naturally, this includes me, and though I definitely skipped a few days to pursue my actual interests (reading, writing, so on), I can't say much worse than half of it being a waste of time, and the other half an okay experience. For most of you who are still in high school or recently graduated (as most of my audience is young, and the audience that most needs my wisdom as a result), this book will be more relevant to you than any other, it being a completely free, short, and exciting read that has earned the distinction of being a book that I can be arsed to read more than once. I cannot say more about how much it changed my perspective on my life, and to exaggerate this point wouldn't do much for my praise, but I will say that Seth is one of the authors who has influenced me most of all, and it takes a special type of man to do that. Basically, you're fucking stupid if you don't read his work. I can't say much more than that.</p>
    <p id=s><img src="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/andfuckhertoo/shitboiyardie.png" title="but nobody can give you permission to be hurt." alt="RATTLING" style="width:20px;height:20px;"> Spook you to Furaffinity, which is a perfectly functional and completely intuitive website that does not feature anything out of the ordinary prattle prattle lies, for featuring the worst of the worst of the culture - along with Inkbunny (haven for nude furry children), DeviantArt (the garbage pile of the Internet), and /r/yiff (predictable). The boorus are exempt from these criticisms, because while their interfaces aren't completely up to par, they have <i>extensive</i> options for finding and filtering content, meaning that it's your fault alone for exposing yourself to gential_multilation wound_penetration infanticide rape. On blatant display on Furaffinity is such gems as "diaper use humiliation regression accidents", "blaziken hermaphrodite noncon cock vore", and "m/m watersports scat petplay" - and though I would not mind this content if it was shelved away under it's own category (as i know little about fetishes and can't judge them due to my ignorance), given that it's in full view for everybody to see so long as you selected the "show me the tiddies" option under your account, I will say there's a limit to what should be under that option, as there is a difference between boring porn and extreme fetish porn. It's fair to say I've seen some shit against my will - and given that these simply-drawn pictures provide a serious abstraction from reality, I can imagine the difficulty in being somebody whose entire job is to deal with disgusting content (border patrol, doctors, EMTs, and so on), when I can barely stomach the fictional depictions of such. The theme of today's post is furries - a fandom that gets better with age.</p>

The things cleaned out? <i>Skeletons</i>. While I <a href="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/buafy/2016-10.html#23">ragged on earlier subreddits</a> for being bullying because of the lack of humanity involved, this subreddit is different because it isn't about attacking the person, but for attacking the content, which is some of the most poorly-presented, overbearing, or otherwise batshit-insane content you'd find on your (or some other dummy) drunk aunt's Facebook feed, inbetween her posting about getting bitten by a tractor and breaking into Starbucks. It's interesting to see all the ideas of the world, the ideas of those people who believe that they are smart without earning the right to be called smart, which illustrates the disconnect that some people have with the way they present themselves, and the way the rest of the world sees them, and it's a big ego check to see somebody like me - wanting to inspire people to be smart - trying not to fall under that banner of "so deep, man". The problem with the subreddit is that it presents the content without any comment, instead providing some snarky title, as if we're supposed to "get it" - the same as we're supposed to "get" the content they criticise. A lot of the posts are true, you see, despite some of them having truly awful, Facebook-style presentation (interesting to see Facebook being synonymous with the lesser), which illustrates the painful lesson that you can be right, dead right even, and still have nobody listen to you because of who you are, and how you present yourself. But then again, a lot of the posts are also dead wrong, so consider the subreddit an exercise in critical thinking. Which of these images do I agree with? Which ones are bullshit? Let's find out, in this new series by Froge, where we look at random pictures online and make fun of them! Or we could move on with our lives. Eh? EH?</p>
    <p id=s><img src="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/andfuckhertoo/shitboiyardie.png" title="but nobody can give you permission to be hurt." alt="RATTLING" style="width:20px;height:20px;"> Spook you to the Microsoft OEM Installation Disk, which I dragged (drug?) out of the depths of Heck, which is actually my closet. Here's a list of things that were in my closet: One, skeletons. Two, the Microsoft OEM Installation Disk. That was all. The Microsoft OEM Installation Disk features a small, non-exhaustive list of licensing terms that apply to everybody who wants to use the product, which I estimate is a thousand words long but can't be arsed to check because it's all of a metre away from me, of which includes that you can only use the disk to install on one PC, you can't engage in the distribution of pirated software (even though somebody pirating Windows wouldn't pay for it anyway), and that you have to apply a super special sticker onto the PC when you install the OS. And to all of this, I was wondering to myself out loud, "Do you really think you have <i>any</i> power over me?". The amount of arrogance that Microsoft shows in peddling this to their customers, demonstrates a complete lack of respect for them as people, and instead more so as profit enhancing devices. I understand a lot of you use Windows (poor bastards), so I won't go for the Linux spiel, because if you're not interested in using the same operating system that supercomputers and the world's most popular websites use, then it's your loss. I will say though, that you've never known harmony with a computer until you've used Linux and got to learn just how much the computer hates you, and not just how it's been tamed through a tacky GUI and more security holes than the United States-Mexico border. Like I said - supercomputer OS! Missing out, mates.</p>

No I don't know what I'm on about, but given that these blokes, who have developed an entire wiki about everything to do with keyboard and keyboard accessories, seem to know what they're doing, the entire effort is impressive - and also fetishistic, as I described. While I'll never need to know the precise details of how to imprint keys onto caps, I suppose there is somebody who will, and will care very much about having those perfect keycaps with which to write with. Beyond that, the information on the underlying switches - which dictate the feel of the keyboard more than any other - as well as the makes of keyboards and what to look out for with each (brown switch 4 life), shows a great deal of respect for the implements that we use every day, without even realising it. Personally I'd like a keyboard with even less actuation force that the minimum of fourty-five grams, though that's because my tiny babby fingers have decided to be little bitches and whine whenever I type. Cut it out, you! I also realised that there will be a point in time where my blog (we hope!) will outlive most of the websites which I write about, and the failure to archive these sites mean that I will be referencing knowledge that is lost, forever, but only with fragments being referenced in sites like mine. It's poetic, really - though would be more so if I was talking about, I don't know, flowers and shit instead of keyboards.</p>

So fuck you for... all of the reasons before, actually, which are all punctuated by <a href="https://indypendent.org/2016/09/19/apped-be-screwed">this article</a> (<a href="https://archive.fo/yhwsJ">archive</a>) and the <a href="https://indypendent.org/2016/10/22/impossible-life-taskrabbit">other one</a> (<a href="https://archive.fo/lsRf3">archive</a>), comparing the work to that of the 19th century industrialist vicitims. It's a system that preys on the lowest-class and unskilled workers, those who do not have any more job opportunities, and exploits them for all they have for minimal pay and mentally damaging - and often physically hazardous - working conditions. It is not a sharing economy when one entity, the company who runs the racket, gets the worker's profits for doing nothing but providing a platform to advertise on; a tithe for a company that does not partake in any of the effort, the blood, or the sweat, that their beligerents suffer through, and yet are so presumptious as to maipulate their audience into believing this is in any way a fair deal. They are aware that their users are on the lowest social class, and are often in poverty, and instead of making more opportunities to help them earn fair wages, they continue to exploit them in the position that they cannot get themselves out of. Indeed, it's beneficial for the company to ensure that the worker never gets out of their lower-class status, as if they were any higher, they would not need to use their service. The malice is blatant for all but the dumbest and most ignorant of people, and anybody who defends this behaviour - who uses the PSE - is just as malicious.</p>

That said, there were some things that I missed, so instead of being a one-stop shop where I farm your clicks and you farm my knowledge and you benefit far more from the ordeal than I do, I'm <s>forced</s> generous enough to recommend this thing to you. When you say something like "Privacy", it becomes stale to the point of meaninglessness, where people get lazy because they assume that, one, nobody cares what they're doing (patent nonsense - it's impossible to know the full extent of how much information somebody has collected on you), or two, they're already safe enough as is. Well, no longer! For your ignorant populace, anti-intellectual to the point where I said "62 to the power of 6" in a presentation and my audience treated me like the special needs kid who likes fire extinguishers, I present to you the <b>Ultimate</b> Privacy Guide, which tells you all about how to minimise the damage you do every single day. I did find it a bit lacking, so I ended up creating a blog out of the desire to cover the angles that I, in all my experience (I'm saying this because people only think you're shit if you have experience - it could happen to you), haven't read up on at all. Even with three months of talking about security solid dick, with the immediate change to what I've always wanted to do - review things - there are still some subjects that I missed. Does this mean that I'll be back to bore you with some <i>web sec</i>................? Maybe.</p>
    <p id=s><img src="https://froghand.neocities.org/buafy/andfuckhertoo/shitboiyardie.png" title="but nobody can give you permission to be hurt." alt="RATTLING" style="width:20px;height:20px;"> Fuck you to the continued insistence of hardware vendors, such as for your processors, graphics cards, motherboards, and so on, for failing to provide open-source versions of the code that makes your hardware work, when such code ensures that the hardware - the area of the computer most vulnerable to interference - is not being compromised by any third-parties, or by the developers who made the hardware. "Oh, Froge," and who the fuck are you? "Talking about privacy and open-source in the same day, are we :3 ? I'm certain that your insistence that you 'abandoned', you sure are going full <i>Stall-maaaan</i> :D ". And to be honest, you furry fuckers don't even deserve a response, though you have the sheer, dumb, luck, to have caught me at a time where I'm obliged to write something here, even though you didn't make any actual arguments, you dumbass. You clown. Here's a bombshell for you: when the basic components required to make your computer run have the potential to be exploited by anybody, even remotely, then you should be rightfully worried that the code that makes the hardware work is not being disclosed to the public - especially when that code affects billions (billions!) of people around the world. Any security fault, or malicious exploit, can bring down the infrastructure of the entire Internet, and so I would be concerned about anybody who isn't worried about such a thing existing. It is unfortunate then that this code ("code" for lack of a better word) is essential to make the things run, and even open-source drivers do not allow them to work at their full potential, locking users into a situation where they have to accept a bad thing, or else their functionality gets shot. Once again, this is the company exerting unjust power over the consumer. It's practices like these which cause domestic terrorism. Maybe.</p>

While I understand that reading 7,000 words about a magician seems like a task for only the most daunting of folks, the article is so damn interesting that you can get through it in twenty minutes, and it's worth every minute that you read. It touches on so many subjects on such a human level, about things that you would have never thought would make you proud, that you start to wonder what you're doing with your life that you can't go out and do the same things that Teller has. Sorry, I meant <i>I</i> start wondering, because the chances are that if you haven't done something beautiful yet, with all your age and experience and the potential to be great, then it will be a long time coming before you decide to fight the laziness and just... do good work. Here's a challenge for you: fight the laziness to get past seven thousand words, and just read through it to the end. Take a day, or a half-hour, and see what happens - a single half-hour out of your thirty-two waking ones, just for me. If nothing else, remember this quote: "Sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect". When something as simple as that has the potential to make you rethink your life like it has mine, then it really is magic.</p>

Alright, so I'm not dissing all of life-action television at once, which would be like saying that Cory i-[SHOT DEAD BY SNIPERS] Sword Art Online ruins the entire medium of anime because they represent the most middle-of-the-ground of the medium. I haven't been talking about art in a long time, which is a damn shame given how much I know about it, so when I say that every live-action television show I've seen assumes that you have the attention span of a goldfish, or a millenial, or breaded eggs, with so many cuts away from the main action in order to show you something else that's happening somewhere else entirely, or with dialogue so fast that you can't understand what they're saying on a level deeper than "I heard it being said", then it shows a great lack of respect for your audience by assuming that if you don't try to manipulate their emotions in the most blatant ways possible, for positive or for negative, then they will fuck off. Though given that it's United States television, whereas British television is a lot calmer, I'm guessing the disrespect is proper, as the only people who would be watching that horrible medium, which I had previously described as a "horrible medium" four sentences ago, would be the ones too ignorant of anything else they could be spending their time on. May you rest in peace television set, shot dead by snipers and pissed on by me.</p>

There was also the bit where they harassed some poor guy on YouTube for being mistaken about the logistics of a button designation, which was an absurd bit that resulted in a Supreme Court case, which you can view for free for $100 (an extra $50 for the DLC). While his Super Mario 64 videos will Blow Your Mind and Destroy Your Penis, speaking for themselves in sheer batshittery, what's more interesting is his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkeok2012/videos">side channel</a>, which talks at length about how the game works, teaching you the fundamentals of programming in a non-threatening way, unlike that time I showed up at MIT in a suicide vest and the snipers blew my jaw clean off.

That said, you know what else is nonsense? When you're installing a program on Linux, for instance, and it says to you "you need to install this thing to make this other thing work!", yet doesn't offer to actually do that, despite having the full rights to. I would think that if you are aware you need something to be installed, and can identify by name what I need to install, then it isn't such a fucking stretch to go out and install it, now is it? The poor design decisions of whoever created Bash is beyond me, but let's see who it - Brian Fox? That sounds suspiciously like "Brian Cox"...

This website has one purpose: pardon gay otters. Also Edward Snowden, which is a little something the admins coded in an hour. While I find it amusing how the people considered United States heroes are the ones who are revealing secrets from a country with so much of them that it makes North Korea look transparent, I support the intent behind the treaty, which is to enslave our government masters and hold them to the same laws that they have set out for us, reinforcing the notion that nobody is above the law. In practice, the USA has built their entire identity on being above the law - internationally and domestically - so as to why Snowden would want to go back is beyond me. But still, if Obama (or whoever the fuck is in office next year i don't know) pardons the man, then it will be a precedent for the United States, saying that "perhaps we shouldn't have lied to our citizens for decades and threatened to execute somebody who revealed that", which will sure to be followed for all of five minutes before the next enhanced interrogation technique.</p>

My entire audio collection (which was all obtained through the MAFIAA allowed-channels with each and every song having proof of purchase I swear on me mum's life) can fit into that puny disk, all fourty-eight hours of it, if you actually compress the git properly and ignore the nerds who think that having that much music is a "small" collection. Granted, the Red Book was made in 1980, so I guess the designers can't be faulted for predicting the wild, wild future of the 2000s. So I guess I'll bitch about international standards costing money to license, instead of them being freely available to the same populace who abides by those standards every fucking day. The Red Book costs $100 to get arbitrary permission to have (an extra $50 for the DLC), even though Sony and Phillips are already making fat fucking bank off the patents, which continues to show companies that just can't get enough of green snakes - I mean greenbacks. How long until some brave soul with a hole in their pocket uploads all the standards for everybody to see forever? They'll be the next Kim Dotcom for sure - a foreign citizen getting fucked over by the United States. Today's article is brought to you by the USA - bringing new lows to the term "first world"!</p>

When you read somebody like wint (<a href="https://twitter.com/dril">@dril</a>) and you see the complete batshittery that goes on his feed every single day, do you think that he's being sincere? Of course not - it's an elaborate satire of what a pathetic loser would whine about in his daily life. While there were some of these copypasta that were originally meant in sincerity, the way they are presented, decontextualised from their original context, means there is no way that anybody can take them seriously now, and so it is impossible to offend the original posters of the pasta because there is no association with them (or any association being so stretched out as to become meaningless), and they are not being posted with malice intent towards the user. While I could write up an article on copypasta as an art form (don't hold me to it), I will say that it embodies sharing culture perfectly - something that nobody expected to be reused or creating being sent to the world like an ether, freely used by anybody for any ironic purpose. That's not even bringing up the copypasta which are made specifically <i>to be</i> copypasta, which is such a great example of taking the piss that my dream job of "copypasta maker" had gone up a few places, but still below "Bad Dragon CEO" and "Clown".</p>

These subreddits originally seem like harmless laughs, but like the homosexual menace, they hide a dark secret within... These subreddits, despite their efforts to anonymise the victims, take the social awkwardness of people, who, either through ignorance, bad timing, a misguided audience, or a simple mistake, and instead of giving them any advice to help them out, decide to share their poor decisions on Reddit in order to laugh at them and then get upvotes. I always lived by the maxim (except as a child, as I was a fucking idiot child) "never mistake for malice what can be explained by ignorance", and it's because of this I never get upset when I see somebody make a mistake, in social terms or otherwise, and instead ignore it or try to explain what would be a better course of action, not saying I'm always successful. The posters of these subreddits, and more like them, decide not to ignore it or help out the victims, and instead choose to abandon their humanity and laugh at them for Internet points. It's bullying, plain and simple, and anybody who thinks they're immune to criticism from bullying because "it's the Internet", honestly doesn't deserve to be reading this blog.</p>

"What the fresh fuck are you on about, Froghand", you say with namesake ignorance stronger than John Cena, "are you suggesting that hackers should lay waste to the Internet and destroy the most important infrastructure in the world?". Good question, Strawman, but it's a strawman - fitting for who you are. My point is twofold: One, the Internet of Things is poorly-secured, reinforcing the idea that anything connected to the Internet, no matter with what apparant security features, can be hacked and manipulated, meaning that it is extremely important to determine what <i>needs</i> to be connected at any given point - but not to go full Stallman and download everything using a terminal (protip: wget https://froghand.neocities.org -r -k -p). Secondly, the vast amount of things that are connected to the Internet means that, at any given point, a vulnerability can shut down the infrastructure of multiple cities all across the world, meaning that the entire world's technology can be turned against a single target, and this is a disasterous thing to leave unchecked. This hack demonstrates that the Internet of Things is a blunt hammer for a problem that nobody had, and the appropiate response is not to go after the hackers, but to change your habits to prevent them from striking further by reducing all that is connected to the Internet, and to ensure that what is, is as secure as you can make it. Or not buy into the Internet of Things, but I suppose that's too daffy, eh?</p>

Nobody, not even the poor bastards who bought a games console, deserves to have such blatant incompetence affect them, and I pray that the industry gets its shit together before it is snubbed out entirely (note: chances of this happening close to zero).</p>

Simpsonwave is when you take vaporwave and shove it into The Simpsons, or at least a vaporwave-like thing and shove it into a Simpsons like thing, which is an incredibly stupid idea, which is why it's so beautiful that it worked out at all. The <a href="https://archive.fo/HVPcg">Wikipedia article</a> (before it was deleted, in accordance with the "No fun allowed" policy), is one of my favourites, being a concise indicator of the way our Web culture works and how, like bacteria in tar, strange things emerge given pure chaos. The video that introduced me to it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTfa-9aCTYg">SUNDAY SCHOOL</a>, is one of the best justifications of remix culture, being thematically solid and excellently edited and an indication of how much The Simpsons has changed from then to now - similar to the timeless, otherworldly culture that Vaporwave presents. A lot of people are willing to shit on the genre because it's turned into a meme. Well, that's because it's so foreign to outside influence that you can't help but look at it with some reverence, and spread it because of it. Strange doesn't mean bad, eh? And though I never expected Simpsonwave to be good, I'm proud to be wrong.</p>

A red moon implies it occurs often, but not all the time. A white moon is more like. My point is that you see a lot of tits on one, and a lack of tits on the other, and we can all agree the choice is necessary to placace the church.

You can display sources and descriptions and all of that, and should you make a mistake after uploading, you can edit it in your browser, also at an instant.

They can watch, they can listen, and the data can be dissimated throughout anybody who needs to know, and those who simply want to hack it, and you have no idea when they're doing any of things, or what the extent of their spying really is. The position of power that companies have over the user is such that they will deliberately disable critical features of a product if you do not accept their abusive terms, and the manipulation and control of technology is as dystopian of a future as I can imagine. The Internet of (Hackable) Things is not just paranoia - it's healthy paranoia, because any device that has the capability to not only track every aspect of your life, but with the ability to seriously hinder your life at any moment at the whims of the company, the government, or some kid with a laptop, is not one that I would ever accept. The only way to protect your freedom is to reject such abusive practices, and only use those devices which run free software.</p>

I suppose that the tender younguns who are browsing my blog think that this means nothing, seeing as they wrangle the power of their own little supercomputer every single day of their lives to do mundane tasks. When you consider a computer from 1981, one that was designed to print text and little else, and see what it's possible to do when you manipulate the hardware of it to the point where it's doing things that nobody could have predicted could exist way back when, you get something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNRO7lno_DM">8088 MPH</a>.

I assume it's for the fat advertising money they're making from the invisible ads they put exclusively for mimes, or to entice the hundreds of thousands of hamsters they use to run the server with. The issue is mundane: Neocities supports HTTPS, but fails to enforce it on a global basis, meaning that you can edit your site in encrypted security, but if you try to read your blog, it's out there in the open for anybody to snoop to it. I understand not wanting to interfere with your users sites, but you already put a "social widgets" file into my site whenever I download it, so I would be okay with you removing that and giving me a file that tells my browser to use HTTPS. It's one of the most basic steps web owners can take to secure their users privacy, and to have spotty enforcement means there will be a great deal of users who will have their liberty infringed by letting anybody spy on the sites they view.</p>

What I do mind is when they're broken and I have zero idea what's going on.

One hell of a microwave, eh? There's not much bad to say about Mint - the GUI is responsive and intuitive, being customisable so you can make up for the developers horrible design decisions (like icons for folders, which makes me think I'm on a children's toy and not a workstation), and everything that you can't do with a GUI you can open up in the Bash console and then scrub some commands that you bootleg off the Web, teaching you a valuable history of building upon the work of previous co-workers through networked interaction and conscious altering of system variables (copying from Stackexchange).

Your faulty drivers, which would not install when I asked them to, which would not allow my computer to boot when I switched to your default drivers, and which wasted three hours of my life trying to get my computer to work again because of your own fucking incompetence - three hours of my life I could have been doing <i>anything</i> else with - have caused me the worst grief that I've experienced in over a month. You have created the least-intuitive and most idiotically designed installation I've ever seen, which I have had the misfortune to learn is the standard for Linux programs, as everything that you don't require searching the answer to online is a miracle in this barren apocalypse. When you asked for root, I gave you root, and when you asked me to shut down my GUI to install a driver - something that you, with <i>root access</i>, should have been able to do - you left me with a blank screen. When I opened the console, your threw up errors when I installed you again, causing it to crash, burn, restart, and leave my computer hanging. It is only after three hours, three hours of which I have wasted specifically because of you, that I have gotten my computer to a workable state - not an optimal one. Not one where everything is back to normal. Just barely workable. Whatever outrage I felt because of you from <a href="#06">last time</a>, whatever outrage I cooled off since then, is now unforgiven.

The paper is truly long, and within that, it boggles the mind a little because of just how much work needs to be put into every one of these opinions - and this is one of the shorter ones, too. When was the last time you had to write an essay for school, and how long and formal did it have to be? If you're a youngblood, as my entire audience is (turn back - strong men only), then it was probably a few pages long without any rigor to it. As you get older, you have to develop more standard and longer forms of writing, neutering your prose as you place filler in the minimum ten or twenty pages or whatver you had to arbitrarily fill out. Consider that this judgement is 43,000 words long - 110% the size of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" - it would be a hellish job to simply write out one opinion through your entire lifetime. You have to write in a way that does not imply any bias outside the facts of the case, where writing objectively for even a few pages is a mentally straining task, as any Wikipedia editor knows, is formatted according to the standard, ensures that all cases cited are correct and factual, does not contain any major errors or ommissions, and has to cross-reference between dozens of other cases and understand the individual facts of each, it's a truly incredible thing to behold that only a few hundred people, most of which who are paid to troll through these opinions, fail to bear witness to the magnitude of these opinions. If judges can spend every day writing out these opinions, in all their bloated, taxing, exhausting glory, for thousands of words at a time, then why the bloody fucking hell can't you work on your novel, or work on your blog, or work on your art, or work at a skill, or work on something that you've always wanted to do in your life? You have all the freedom and time with none of the rigour, so the only thing stopping you is your own damn laziness. I would like to thank all the judges - right or wrong or retarded or otherwise - for creating these opinions, because whenever I feel like my job is too hard, I just look at an opinion and realise it could be far, far worse.</p>

It's important to note that nudity by itself is not a problem, unless you're some prude that has a problem with the very same cocks and twats that you possess (not at once, unless you're rare). I simply wish to see nudity expressed in more creative ways than just "I want to fuck this thing right now without any consequence", damaging the furry fandom's reputation as a mecca for creative sexuality, instead being seen as an appeal to base emotions. Granted, sometimes those appeals are nice, but when it appears all the bloody time, it wears thin, making it harder to appreciate the innately sexual nature of the furry fandom (that some furries are trying to cover up, which is like telling Iran to stop exporting oil). I commend all artists that express their sexuality in more creative ways than what is on display at /r/yiff, including those that somehow got to the top slots of the subreddit, as it improves your culture, and your audience, immensely. Incidentally, my mother is now viewing this website - please enjoy this blatant pandering to a subgroup of people that I may or may not happen to be in. No, I'm not a yiffer - I'm just pretending to be. Incidentally, I am also <i>not</i> racist, and <i>not</i> a terrorist, and I <i>am</i> training to become a doctor to rack up those good boy points from parents who have been out of my life for many years. Fucking bitch.</p>

You never know what you're going to get with these types of books - it's almost like they have their entire purpose written in the title. The book takes a no-holds-barred approach to programming, teaching you less about how to grind out a language for everyday work, and more so becoming a computer wizard, because the computer hates you, and everybody who uses a computer knows this. It's also very useful for encouraging people to get off their ass and learn how to use Linux, thanks to its EZPZ setup guide that is <i>just</i> outdated enough so as to make you learn things by yourself - always good for experience! It comes with a bunch of videos and a lot of examples and prose that isn't shit at all, which is incredible given how so many textbooks maximise shit and minimise content. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the videos to work, as I had blatantly pirated a copy from a Polish tracker site along with my Call of Duty: Advance Warfare hacks, which was totally not a virus me mum swears on me life. With this book, I'll code my own cool hacks - and then sell it to you at the market price of ten grams of weed.</p>

When you take a terabyte hard drive that costs fifty dollars, shove it into a ten dollar hard drive case, and then sell the end result for a hundred and twenty dollars, you have done little more than charge double the price of a product that a consumer can easily make by themselves. These products appeal to the worst of people - those too lazy or ignorant to learn how to create inexpensive, yet just as effective goods for people who are willing to build them within a few minutes. You might say that they are paying for the idiot-proof convenience, or for having proprietary software that snoops on the hard drive, or for having a good-looking one. My boy, when you idiot-proof your work, only idiots will use your work. I encourage all my readers to not buy into the scam of overpriced goods that you can create yourself - such as prebuilt PCs, home security systems, and emulatable games consoles, and instead learn how to create what you want using the parts you can buy for cheap, saving you money and teaching you valuable job skills in the process. Say no to prebuilts whenever possible - and for what you can't build, make a choice that protects your freedom.</p>

This is going to be a phrase worthy of shitting yourself over, but I think a game company is doing a really good job. I got through that sentence without being assassinated, so I'm sure somebody agrees with me when I say that Jagex is one of the more ethical multiplayer gaming companies out there. Granted, it isn't that hard, given that the competition treats their customers like lab rats, experimenting on them like the little babies that Facebook adopts and then trains to remove clickbait. Given that Jagex is giving away 20% of the bloody game for free, separating paid accounts and free accounts like 8 Mile, this coincides with their anti "pay to win" philosophy, which states that nobody can use money to gain an advantage. This fifteen-year-old policy is in stark fucking contrast to a game like Overwatch which not only costs eighty fucking dollars brand new, but also expects you to pay in-game microtransactions to get new shit. Meanwhile, Runescape is free, and for ten bucks a month, you get access to a massive expansion pack that would be well worth the eighty dollars you would normally spend on Overwatch, a Bad Game For Twats Trademarked Hope Nobody Notices I've Never Played The Game. It's kind of fitting that Jagex adopted this policy in the tender years of 2002 - an employee in 2016 would be executed for suggesting such a thing.</p>

Then it was the runners, and I did not speak up, because they rejected my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-uU1awamtY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Yoshi's Story run</a>  for three years in a row and I had money on that shit.

Forty fucking gigabytes! For a game released in 2004! I remember when we had games on cartridges the size of your fist, with eight megabytes of storage on them, and you made the most out of that goddamn storage or else the entire project got cancelled. And they charged you eighty bucks for that eight megabytes, and compare that to an era where eighty bucks gets you two terabytes of data on a good day, and you understand just how lazy today's programmers have the privilege to be. Back in the day, programmers were wizards. They had to make the most out of their incredibly underpowered hardware to get games to run - it was a miracle that we got any good games at all out of things like the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 64, just because of the limitations of the systems. Nowadays everybody has computers that would have cost a million dollars just ten years ago, and programmers are using that power to make sloppy, unoptimised, uncompressed work, regardless of how much stuff actually deserves to be in a game. World of Warcraft isn't a blockbuster, shit-yourself game by any means - and it doesn't even have the graphics to poorly justify that amount of space. I bet, given a decent crunch of the game's content, it could be reduced down to ten gigabytes. At least then it would be representative of what is actually in the game, and not the grindy-walky it is.</p>

Awful font aside, it is a piece of proprietary nagware that uses CNET and Softpedia for its downloads. Strange - usually when you say "aside", you're supposed to put something positive in front of it. Noncontiuum aside, the software is a "robust" piece of work, and robust is code for "fucking awful interface", though it is robust, and "robust" is also code for "has a lot of features as well as a fucking awful interface". It lets you hook up any gamepad that can interface with your computer and assign keyboards to it, letting the controller spoof the exact functionality of each key, effectively letting you play any PC game with your controller. You can also write the Great American Novel on your NES controller, and if you do, please send me your config files so I can, too.

These factors discourage the use of strong, randomly-generated passwords, in favour of a random asshole making their own up on the spot, and the potential to forget something like "random_assh0le" is as large as the potential for somebody to crack that password. Unless the server owner wants a rainbow table Python Lucky Seven attack on its MD5 salt database django, I suggest they get rid of the "maximums" for passwords, and focus more on the "minimums", encouraging people to create, and I understand this is basic dick but it is still solid dick, passphrases that are computationally harder to break and easier to remember, as well as leading them to password managers like <a href="http://masterpasswordapp.com/">Master Password</a>, as well as my <a href="../masterpassword.html">Master Password</a> article, which features a lot of information about said Python Ubuntus.

Released for the Nintendo DS, and another entrant in the great "best games library" debate, being brutally contested by the PlayStation 2 and said Nintendo DS, this humble cartridge was released recently enough where it can't be considered retro, but long enough where a few people can get nostalgic over the good old days of 2010 - the year of shitty Cheezburger Network memes. Have you heard of Mario Paint? Probably, unless you're in a reclusive common law relationship with a rock and your pebble children, living out your days underneath a hard place. This game is indeed Mario Paint, though you can also make your own five-second video games and comics as well as composing songs. The reason I bring it up is because I actually learned a fucking lot from this game about how games work - that's all they are, fucking flags! There's a flag to do this and a flag to do that and you slap some graphics over and away we go. It teaches you the fundamentals of game design in a way so easy that even a toddler can do it, with an engine complicated enough to even allow for some clever hacks if you're a <s>shitty</s> resourceful programmer. Not only that, the music and comic making software is advanced enough to be a good start for anybody to begin their creative dreams. A damn shame it wasn't ported to PC, as mouse control would have been the bomb. On an unrelated note, <a href="https://www.emuparadise.mobi/">emuparadise.me</a> features the largest collection of no-bullshit Nintendo DS ROMs on the Web, which is an excellent companion piece to the <a href="https://desmume.org/">DeSmuME</a> emulator, the most advanced Nintendo DS emulator on the market today!

For somebody who isn't a cunt, and therefore is me, the principle of MEGA - protecting the privacy of its users for whatever reason, not just copywrong related ones, is a noble one that must be upheld in times where your government will arbitrarily search your files for fear of terrorists or the gays or whatever the meme is nowadays. The principle is solid - which is why it is such a damn shame, damn damn shame, the website is coded by a team of monkeys. Uploading files causes your connection to saunter between 90% and 10% of its potential every few seconds, almost like it was using shitty BitTorrent, completing an upload gives you a 50% chance of it showing up in your files after you close the page, and a 50% chance of causing the last three hours you spent watching it to poof into thin air, and the website has a user interface slower than bloody Tumblr. I don't know what dark magic occurs beneath MEGA's surface, but given that it is one of the only safe file hosting options today (though remember to encrypt your data yourself before uploading), I expect better from the flagship "the Internet privacy company".</p>

I should note, however, that if you are going to showcase something on the front page of a website that is viewed by over twenty million people every day, you would showcase something more impressive than a map of the world, or a coin photographed on a black background - as if you have seen one coin or one map, you have seen the all, and though coin fetishists would tell you otherwise, they are fucking boring. I would appreciate it very much if the dozen or so ants that make up the Featured Pictures squad could showcase works of art that makes me stare intently at the screen and wonder how I lived my life to deserve such beauty - works like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Accolade_by_Edmund_Blair_Leighton.jpg">Accolade</a>", where the more you look at it, the more inspired you are.

A little bit of context - Slick Rick is one of the most influential rappers in the game, being famous in the early stages of hip-hop for his storytelling and performances, but fading into obscurity in the 21st century as he stopped producing new albums and his style grew out of the public eye. Interesting to note that "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM0KAh5w7Rs">La Di Da Di</a>" has been sampled over 500 times, and if you know anything about House music, you'll probably have heard the samples he invented without even realising he invented them - even the "Hypnotise" verse was all him. "Behind Bars" came much later in his career, where he was stuck in jail and with nothing to do, leading to a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdhz6NROC44">interviews</a> in prison, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfItmYi4npg">one from 1994</a> that was uploaded by a bee, though none of which telling who did the animation on the video - which is a shame considering how damn good it is.

That's why they're in the "fuck you" section - they're fucking with me, so I'm fucking with them by saying fuck you. That's the purpose of the "fuck you" section. It's to say "fuck you". So "fuck you", Nvidia, or maybe NVIDIA, but I can't be arsed to [program halted - loop detected]. Nvidia recently let out an update to their software that updates drivers, except <a href="https://archive.is/EnQy6">it will no longer do that</a> unless I sign up for either a Facebook, Google, or NVIDIA account, and tying everything I do to a single account with a piece of hardware that is directly plugged into my computer is something I'm not willing to let any of those companies snoop on. A person should never have to sign up for an account for automatic updates that are a fundamental part of customer support - though it seems that the standards for companies in the New 10s have been so lax that a lazy populace will let any shit be shoved down their gullets and they won't even mind.  This issue is so obvious that I don't even need to make any points for it, as to hold hostage fundamental firmware updates unless you agree to have all your activity associated with one account, is such an affront to digital liberties that they are self-apparent. Naturally, I won't be buying from Nvidia anymore, and I encourage anybody who has done the same to <a href="https://archive.fo/EdBin">e-mail NVIDIA</a> (info@nvidia.com) and tell them your feelings on the matter.</p>

If I recommended you my blog recently and you're just tuning in now, then you might be assuming I'm taking the piss. I must ask you then to cease your microfurgressions and your passive fursection of my people, proud as they may be, so long as nobody pulls out their dick for the gorilla who must not be named for fear of having its legacy be tarnished. Furries are like those little rat Tribbles from Star Trek - they exist to eat and fuck, and are born pregnant, yet also having an eighty year life span and access to the Internet to bum around with. I'm wondering what the point of this site is, to be honest. Here we have a culture that is almost universally bullied for having the balls to be outside the standard deviation for acceptable levels of "normal", and they want to create a site you can look at in public so you can be bullied some more. Maybe there are furries out there that don't like porn, but that's like a BDSM fetishist who doesn't like spankings - possible, though you have to wonder why you got into the fandom in the first place if you're going to cut out 90% the content like Civilisation V. But anyway, it's better to have the option to not be lewded up without your consent, and I am enjoying the challenge of finding the most sexual image on there that still warrants a "safe" rating, so please enjoy this honourary mention in the annals of Froge.</p>

I think it's telling about a company when just a decade ago it was considered one of the coolest sites on the Web, a source of unabashed creativity and community, where memes lived and died like they were nothing - only for the site to offer itself for vivisection and spend the last three years spasming at every opportunity Google takes to cut into it. Nowhere is this more reflective than the most popular videos on YouTube, which I have previously described as the "TMZ" as websites, but is now better described as the "TLC" of the Web: a series of lowest-common-demoninator advertisements, sponsored content, and pop culture pandering that exists only to extract advertising revenue from the most disinterested and barely-alive populace that exists today. YouTube is promoting a culture of novelty and instant gratification, where anything that gets views, no matter how vapid it is, is ripe to be picked off of its website, without caring one bit for standards of quality or what it does to the audience it subjects it to. I suppose that comparison to prolefeed is accurate, after all. A series of videos made by people who barely register in their own lives, shipped off to consumers even worse off than them, designed to placate them to keep watching more videos and make them money, killing their ambition by telling them it's perfectly okay to be average, when past and current events show that the average person is a <i>disposable</i> person, and will have no impact on a world made by the computers that replace them. It's a wide world full of opportunity, but with YouTube, it might as well not exist.</p>

It's short, sweet, and with Jim's "stage presence" constantly providing a source of entertainment. I'm saying he's big. No, I don't know if he's fat. Is Penn Jilette fat? I don't know. I'm saying he's big. <s>Fuck you</s> Jim Sterling is one of the few good voices in the gaming industry, and one of the few good voices on YouTube in general, saying smart things in a way that combines an appropiate ego with an optimism for video games that you just don't find anymore - something I'm trying to revive, actually. I was going to use this video as a source for my "<a href="../reviewers.html">Review of Game Reviewers</a>", which nobody reads because I titled it like a Wikipedia article, but I ended up not doing so because it was so damn good that I didn't need no man to support it. The video is as good as my article, and I made a good article so you damn well know that it's good, and it summarises some of the points of entitled gamers and the pressure that reviewers face, points that I didn't cover because I focused instead on what reviewers do and not the reactions they provoke. To fill in the gap, please watch the video. And if you don't give a shit, watch it anyway, because "A show in which a fat British man who wears sunglasses indoors rants angrily about the injustices of mankind" (he's fat after all!) is one worth watching. Side note: the "<a href="http://www.thejimquisition.com/oversnatch-a-xxx-parody-reviewed/">Oversnatch: A XXX Parody</a>" review, is fucking incredible.</p>

Beyond the typical Google spiel of Web storage (and spying on your photos), a new cell phone (and thus spying on your calls), and Chromecast (spying on everything you watch), there's also the brand new Google Home G-Thing, which is rapidly developing technology to the "Trash Can Singularity", which is the theoretical point where every new computer looks like a trash can. I always wanted an air freshener in every room of my house recording everything that I do at every hour, being shipped off to some company in California which has enough employees to create their own nation state, and then have that data be remotely exploited by some kid with a laptop so <i>they</i> know what I do as well. I'm pissed off at all of these, naturally, though it's more so in the narrarative of "fuck Apple" that butters my toast against the grain. We should all say "<a href="https://stallman.org/apple.html">fuck Apple</a>", but come on, it's coming from a multi-billion dollar company, not some youngblood with a green blog. It comes off as Google dick-riding apple, the same way Microsoft is dick-riding Linux, trying to lend the olive branch before detonating the bomb vest and shitting the joint up. Google even ripped off the iPhone design, trying to position themself as "an iPhone but better", which isn't very hard seeing as Apple has been phoning it in for the past three years and everybody who isn't a teenager is catching up to their old tricks. I didn't even like the design that much, save for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5C">tasty 5C</a>, but Google ripping it off shows a lack of respect for anything you do in your industry. I would say the mobile phone industry is a pissing contest to appeal to the lowest-common-denominator, but that's giving it too much credit.</p>

Sadly, there is very little vaporwave in the KEATS COLLECTIVE, which is sad considering how cool the counter-culture was way back when, only to swiftly die and be absorbed by Google's Materials Design - and you know a company is aiming for a monopoly when it absorbs our fucking aesthetic. While I'm hoping that vaporwave doesn't die out, as it is one of the most unique things to ever come out of the Internet, it seems like future funk is taking its place as the hot new counter-culture for the denizens of /mu/ and all those who rip it off. Enjoy, ye monsters, the sound of the future, and conveniently ignore that it is more house than funk.</p>

The fact of the matter is that I have had nothing substantial to complain about, and this is not because I am too lazy to write things - indeed, I have been writing the equivalent of a novel every month, and this little paragraph is about the same length as what I would write normally. Sometimes you have to step back and look at the world that there is little you have to complain about, as to focus on squabbles to the point where they become petty is to focus on the moles on an otherwise very pretty face. I could bitch about my own life, but, that's my thing, and if it can't help your thing, why even bring attention to a thing? Let's all talk about my theoretical swamp crotch, shall we? Oh, that won't do, because half my audience hasn't even had their balls drop. Low blow!</p>

There's a lot to say about this website, but I like the following train of thought. Wikipedia is good at the extremes - when it comes to facts, its editors make sure that facts are fairly expressed, even if the facts are agreed upon by popular vote, which is why it entertains the idea of religion while ignoring the unpopular, though correct scientific views. When it comes to patent nonsense, its editors destroy bullshit at a rate greater than any for-profit editor for, as an army of clerks will always out perform the expert. When it comes to the inbetweens, Wikipedia is <i>really</i> bad at taking a stance, which is why articles that rely solely on opinions, such as controversy, ignores rational points of view in favour of showcasing the blandest ones. If you get published by a reliable source, then you're in, no matter how stupid you are. I especially like the article's link to a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081224020557/http://www.wired.com/software/webservices/commentary/alttext/2006/04/70670">Wired article</a>, with the quote "Experts are scum", which is something I'd like to use in the future, though probably won't due to already having a large backlog of quotes, much like the Wikimedia backlog of cocks.</p>

All of this is supported by Cloudflare, who has decided, in the typical genius of Web-based startups, to censor content for Tor users despite there being no evidence that Tor users are more malicious than regular ones. The web page then has the balls to suggest that I have malware on my machine. Fuck you, Cloudflare. We both know why you're blocking me - it's because you hate me for trying to have some decent fucking privacy. The same for the other thousands of people you decide to fuck over by allowing this shittery to happen. I will continue to bitch about both Google and Cloudflare until you stop hiding massive portions of the Web - which will be around the same time God comes out of the clouds and cures AIDS, E.G. a fucking pipe dream.</p>

I'm not bad at art... <i>society</i> is. It also has that charming Japanese quality of saying "fuck you" to the user and only offering a proprietary Windows-only download, because imagination is as foreign to Japanese business as white people. I'm not racist... <i>Japan</i> is. No, this isn't some preclude to my thirty-day trial of doing art challenges and seeing what shit stinks. Such a thing doesn't exist! It is however, a preclude to getting rid off all the emoji and adding in my own, serving the dual purpose of saving precious bytes that will be used to write rap lyrics with, and stopping the copyright vultures from coming down and fucking my shit up.

I'm blaming Windows here, but it's the same thing with all partitioning programs - whatever dark magic that SSDs run off of, it's fucking up the system. You would think that, in a perfect world, a hard disk and a solid state drive would be functionally the same to the end-user as the operating system takes care of the hard stuff for them, but it turns out that operating systems are hard, especially in an industry with more arbitrary standards than an abusive parent. And about Linux Mint, it turns out that my <a href="2016-09.html#13">previous complaint</a> about installation being arcane turned out to be pretty simple, so long as you read a <a href="https://archive.is/1332s">500 word document</a> with pictures, and then print it out while you're installing.
